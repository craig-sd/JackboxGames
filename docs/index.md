## Requirements

The JackBox games support remote play with your friends when using Steam. You won't need to buy any games in Steam, just install it and accept the game invite.

Steam can be installed on both Mac and Windows machines.

In addition to the Mac or Windows machine you will need one phone/tablet for each person that wants to play at your house. Nothing needs to be installed on the phone/tablet.
